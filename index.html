                <h2>MP Insight</h2>
                <p class="accent">Created in 2023 for COSC345</p>
                <P>The requirements of this paper was to create a C++ windows app that made use of two datasets. I worked in a team of four, over the course of a semester. Our team decided to create an app that made use of data about current MP’s, to help inform the public about them, particularly coming up to the 2023 election. We created the Gui using the Qt framework, used a SQLite database, and python to scrape the data we collected from the parliament website. </P>

                <P>This is imaging editing software, that was the group project in the COSC202 paper. The base of the software wasn’t coded by my group, but by the lecturers, we were given the task of implementing various features. I focussed mainly on the filters, macros, and exception handling. </P>

                <P>This is a website which is meant to be a learning resource for the micro:bit which is a beginner friendly micro-controller. I researched, designed, and coded the website. It’s coded in html, CSS, and little bit of JavaScript for the front page.</P>

                <P>A simulation of a queue at my high school cafeteria. The programme will ‘do something’ for every second in an hour, and it will remove people when they have been served, and add people as time goes by. This was the first large project I coded from scratch in java. The NCEA standard required the use of various complex techniques, I used a linked-list data structure to represent a queue, and the programme is able to read data from other files. </P>

                <P>This is a website meant to encourage people to cycle as a form of transport. It discuses several different reasons; environment, convenience, health, and money. It also uses sql to access a php server to find the different amount of fuel different cars use, this accessed a local sever at my high school, so it’s not currently working.</P>

                <P>This is a website all about the sport Under-water hockey. I played under-water hockey in high school, so I thought I’d make a website all about it, with a focus on the exact New Zealand rules, and standards and relegations to do with refereeing. This was the first time I tried to make a website with responsive design, and while it was a good learning experience, it didn’t really go well for me.</P>
