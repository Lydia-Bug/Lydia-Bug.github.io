	  <h1>Cycling uses no fuel</h1>
	  <p>Cycling uses no fuel or electricity to use. This means no greenhouse emmisions that are contributing to climate change.</p>

	  <h1>Less energy and resources to make a bicycle</h1>
	  <p>Bicycles are smaller and have no large engines like cars do. This means aswell as not using up any feul it also used up a lot less energy and resources to create then a car would have. </p>

		<h1>Doesn't require toxic batterys or moter oil </h1>
		<p>Cars use lots of toxic products to run and to maintain. These extras materials required use resources and enery to create, which cycling doesn't require. And this materials are very toxic and when not disposed of propberly can end up in our waterways.</p>

		<p>And those are just the pollutants from fuel use. From the foam and plastic in its seats to the petroleum in its tires, each car is a small pollution factory. Several tons of waste and 1.2 billion cubic yards of polluted air are generated in its manufacture alone! In 2008 the US produced 1.6 million billion metric tons of waste mining ore for automotive production. In the US each year, painting and coating cars produces 40 million pounds of air releases and 24 million pounds of hazardous wastes.</p>
		<p>During its lifetime, on the road, each car produces another 1.3 billion cubic yards of polluted air and scatters an additional 40 pounds of worn tire particles, brake debris and worn road surface into the atmosphere.</p>
		<p>Bicycling significantly reduces transportation emissions while also reducing traffic congestion and the need for petroleum. The total number of pounds of pollutants, (comprised of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide), emitted per year is 12,140.30 lbs/year (or 0.97 lbs/mile) for passenger cars and 17,025.80 lbs/year (or 1.21 lbs/mile) for light trucks.</p>
