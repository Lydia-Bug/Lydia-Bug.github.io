			<h3 class="subtitle">The basics of Underwater Hockey</h3>
			<p class="text">Underwater hockey is played on the bottom of the pool. Players use small sicks, that are about 20cm wide to push the puck around the bottom of the pool into the other teams goal bin and out of theirs.<br /><br />Underwater hockey is played with six players from each team in the water, and a maximum of four substitutes sitting at the edge of the pool; a minimum of four players can be in the pool, if the whole teams doesn’t turn up.<br /><br />Teams start at their side of the pool and swim to the puck (middle) when the referees signal the start of the game. Players can use many skills to gain or keep possession of the puck, or these include, passing the puck, turning on the puck, flicking, dummieing, and other methods of tackling.<br /><br />When the puck is in one teams goal bin, a point has been scored and both teams return to their side of the pool.<br /><br />There are many rules for underwater hockey but not many are necessary to play the game, you’ll learn all the infringements over time, just remember to not do anything dangerous, to not touch the puck with anything other than your stick, and to not do anything that seems unfair, or illegal.

				<ul>
					<li>
						The goalie is the most defensive player and in general should be behind the rest of their team, in case someone from the other team gets past them. That is not to say that goalies do nothing though, goalies are a very important part if the team and it’s not uncommon for goalies to get breakaway goals.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<li><b>Back wing x 2</b></li>
				<ul><li>The right back wing, and left back wing play a defensive role, going for the puck when they see the other team with it, back wings should still backup there forward teammates and not just stay at the back though.</li></ul>

				<li><b>Center x 1</b></li>
				<ul><li>The center tries to stay on the puck for the whole game, not playing defensively but not actively going after it to get a goal.</li></ul>

				<li><b>Strikers/forward x 2</b></li>
				<ul><li>Forwards are offensive players actively chasing after the puck to get a goal. Forwards are the first players to go do at the start of the game, equal and advantage pucks</li></ul>
