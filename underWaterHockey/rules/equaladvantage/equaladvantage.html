	    	<h1 class="subtitle">How to play an equal puck?</h1>
			<p class="text">The puck is placed where the infringement happened, as long as its two meters away from the sides, and 5 meters away from the endline. Both teams must be on their side of the puck. When the referee signals both teams can go down. Normally to get down faster someone will push another player down to the puck.</p>

			<h1 class="subtitle">How to play an advantage puck?</h1>
			<p class="text">The puck is placed where the infringement happened, as long as its two meters away from the sides, and 5 meters away from the endline. The team who was awarded the advantage puck may go anywhere they like, the team who the advantage puck is against them must stay behind the referee's imaginary line. When the referees signal the team awarded the advantage puck has 5 seconds to touch the puck, once they have the other team may cross the line. If the other team crosses the line before the other team has touched the puck, then another advantage puck is called and the puck is moved another three meters backwards</p>
