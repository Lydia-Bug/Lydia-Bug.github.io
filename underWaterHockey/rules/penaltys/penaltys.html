			<h1 class="subtitle">What constitutes a penalty shot?</h1>
			<p class="text">A penalty shot can be awarded if a goal was very likely to have happened if not for the other team infringing on them. A penalty shot can only be given if the infringement happens within 3 meters of the goal. An example of this would be if a player was very close to the goal and in possession of the puck, and then someone hit their stick with their own stick (stick infringement) causing them to lose control of the puck and not get the goal they probably would have gotten.

		<div class='box' id='penaltygoal'>
	    	<h1 class="subtitle">What constitutes a penalty goal?</h1>
			<p class="text">A penalty shot can be awarded if a goal would have definitely happened if not for the other team infringing on them. A penalty goal can only be given anywhere in the pool. An example of this would be if a player who was in possession of the puck was getting a breakaway with no players in front of them, had another player pull of their flipper so they were unable to swim all the way to the goal.</p>

		<div class='box' id='setup'>
			<h1 class="subtitle">How does a penalty shot work?</h1>
			<p class="text">The team that was awarded the penalty shot can have two attackers, and the team the penalty shot was awarded against can have one defended, these players can be anyone in the team except people in the penalty box. All other players must get out of the pool.<br />The puck is placed at the three-meter mark. The defender must stat touching the wall, the attackers must start behind the puck.<br />When the penalty shot starts the attackers must touch the puck within five seconds, otherwise the penalty shot is unsuccessful. The defender can move down the wall along as they are still touching it.<br />When the attackers have the touched the puck they must try and get a goal with it, and the defender must try and take off the puck 6 meters away from the goal. If any players infringe its the other player's goal/no goal.<br />When a goal is scored, or the puck is taken six meters away, a goal or no goal is awarded, and both teams go to their side of the pool, to start the game again as if a goal has been scored.</p>
